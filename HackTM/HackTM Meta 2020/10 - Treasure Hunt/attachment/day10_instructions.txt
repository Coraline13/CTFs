coordinates(x, y) give the starting position of a point: 
 a negative value of x shows how far left the point is
 a positive value of x shows how far right the point is
 a negative value of y shows how far up the point is  
 a positive value of y shows how far down the point is

movement(x, y) shows how a point moves relative to its position.

For example: coordinates(5, 5) movement(1, -1). The point is moving right and up. After 3 steps it will be at (8, 2).
