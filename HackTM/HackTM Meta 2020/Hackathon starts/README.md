### Description

Sebastian, a volunteer, passes by and you ask him for the WIFI password. He tells you "Everyone has the password on their table. The password is under the c... " but he gets interrupted by an urgent phone call.

Rudely enough, he hands you a USB stick and leaves.

**Note:** The scoring for this challenge is dynamic.

### Attachment

`wifi_pass.rar`

### Solution

There are some hints in the challenge body and in `readme.txt`. 
First, the text starts with Sebastian, a volunteer. Sebastian is the name of the red, Jamaican-accented crab who serves as King Triton's advisor and "distinguished" court composer.
Second, there is ***"The password is under the c... "***. If you read this out loud it becomes ***"Under the Sea"***, a song which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1990.
Third, the volunteer "has the memory of a crab", Sebastian being a crab.
Fourth, all three examples say that it is a Walt Disney Production. 

In case you're still wondering, all hints lead to `TheLittleMermaid`, which is the password you need to open the archive. Inside it, you may find the flag `HackTM{nuesteparola}`.
