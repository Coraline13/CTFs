### Description

The whole 11 dimensions thing drained the last bit of energy you had left. You go back at your laptop, commit your progress and decide to go home and get some rest before continuing with your amazing project. You know the buses are waiting in front and you can count on them as there won't be a traffic jam at this late hour.

As you walk past the entrance, into the night, the chill wind wakes you up a bit. Heading towards the pickup point, you observe the street lights are malfunctioning and that there are no buses. Instead, there's a big glowing circle of light hanging in the air. Like the ones Dr. Strange used to make. You're not going to walk home so you decide to investigate. As you get closer and look through the middle of the circle, a very familiar chamber seems to be on the other side of it. You gasp as you recognize your own room.

"That's great!" you think and jump directly into it.

Instead of landing directly on your bed, there's concrete under your feet. You're still here, on the other side of the circle. Your left forearm starts itching and as you roll up your sleeve a keyboard materializes in the air next to you. On your forearm some random characters start appearing and they won't come off. Above them you can read "Activation Code".

In order for you to activate the portal to your room, you need to enter the activation code formed by those characters.

**Note:**

The scoring for this challenge is dynamic.

Submit your solution in the following format: `HackTM{activation_code}`. There are no spaces in `activation_code`.

### Solution

As you stand in front of the portal you only have a string of characters and a keyboard to use.
Tracking every character group on the keyboard, each form a letter.
