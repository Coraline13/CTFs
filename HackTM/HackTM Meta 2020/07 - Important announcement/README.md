### Description

Your effort pays off and you're on your way to making an amazing project. Everything goes as planned, you even had time to enjoy a good cup of coffee.

As caffeine kicks in, you zone out focusing on your codebase and the background sound of the mechanical keyboards.

Suddenly, all other participants leave their seats heading in the same direction towards the entrance. You look around and notice that Diana, the MC, is leaving the stage as she made an important announcement.

What did she say?

**Note:**

The scoring for this challenge is dynamic.

When youâ€™ll find the flag, it will be obvious. Do not try to submit a possible answer by placing it in between curly brackets using the flag format `HackTM{your_answer}`.

### Attachment

`day7.zip`

### Solution

The challenge provided the players with 2 files:
`chall.html` `chall.js`

The .html file consisted of an input field and a button to validate the input text.  

The .js file implemented the validation functionality for the input text.  

However, in order to understand the functionality, the players are required to deobfuscate the source code.  

Once a more readable version of the file is made, the players can retrieve the conditions which build up the flag.
