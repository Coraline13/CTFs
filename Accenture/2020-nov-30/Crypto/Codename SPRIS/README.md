### Description

"If you read this message, it means I have been compromised. But that doesn't mean this mission is over. You NEED to disarm the death ray satellite. I have encrypted the disarm code so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

You HAVE to decrypt the key before it's to late. I hid everything you need in the image.

Here is the key:

fdd63b5cdf3141295b3e002b4b6dbad113e098c642bc5b2ea0a9806bd758aa0fa211347965452786d95f23c9ea5c5d04

Please hurry, there isn't much time."

Edit: When you find the new key, remove it to get the correct result!
